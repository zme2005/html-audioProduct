# ðŸ§ª Simple HTML Product Page (Practice Project)

Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly HTML project I created as part of my journey to learn web development â€” starting from HTML.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a basic HTML page that showcases a fictional electronic product.  
It includes the following features:
- Clean HTML structure
- Text formatting using headings, paragraphs, and inline tags
- Product images with titles and alt text
- A video preview using the <video> tag
- Sample audio using the <audio> tag
- A table displaying product information
- The <marquee> tag for animated text (used intentionally for practice)

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

I'm currently learning HTML and created this project to apply what Iâ€™ve learned so far.  
Some tags used (like <marquee>) are outdated and not recommended for real-world websites, but theyâ€™re helpful at this learning stage.

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback

This is an open learning project, and I would love to hear any tips or suggestions to help me improve.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- HTML5 (only)
- No CSS or JavaScript â€” yet!

---

## ðŸŒ± What's Next

In future versions of this project, I plan to:
- Add CSS for better design
- Replace outdated tags
- Improve layout and accessibility
