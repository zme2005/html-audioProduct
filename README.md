# 🧪 Simple HTML Product Page (Practice Project)

Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly HTML project I created as part of my journey to learn web development — starting from HTML.

---

## 🔎 What This Project Includes

- A fictional product landing page
- Clean HTML structure using:
  - <h1> to <h6> headings
  - <p>, <mark>, <strong>, <s> and other text elements
  - <img> tags for product designs
  - <video> tag to preview a sample video
  - <audio> tag to listen to sample audio
  - <table> with <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>
  - <marquee> tag (used intentionally for fun and practice!)

## 🧠 Why This Project?

I’m currently learning HTML and I wanted to put theory into practice.  
This project is not meant to be production-grade or follow all best practices — it’s about building, testing, and growing.

---

## ⚠ Note

Some elements (like <marquee>) are deprecated and shouldn’t be used in real projects — but I’ve included them here to explore and understand how older HTML worked.  
Once I learn CSS, I’ll replace them with proper modern alternatives.
